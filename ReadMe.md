# MachineLearning

This repository contains python codes for few machine learning algorithms namely: Decision Tree, K_Means and Logistic Regression. 
>Decisontree_sklearn.py requires file 'PastHires.csv' dataset to be downloaded. 

>'Logistic_regression.py' requires file 'diabetes1.csv' to be downloaded.

>abc.png is a file related to DecisionTree_sklearn.py and requires one to download GraphViz from https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/.

>DecisionTree_sklearn.py uses library sklearn whereas Decision_Tree_CART.py implements the algorithm from scratch.
