# MachineLearning
This repository contains python codes for few machine learning algorithms namely: Decision Tree, K_Means and Logistic Regression. 
*Decisontree_sklearn.py requires file 'PastHires.csv' dataset to be downloaded. 
*'Logistic_regression.py' requires file 'diabetes1.csv' to be downloaded.
*abc.png is a file related to DecisionTree_sklearn.py and requires one to download GraphViz from https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/.
*DecisionTree_sklearn.py uses library sklearn whereas Decision_Tree_CART.py implements the algorithm from scratch.
